# Login with SAML

Once SAML is configured users can visit `https://<YOUR_TERRAFORM_ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN>/session` to login.

They can follow the link to complete the SAML login process with the identity provider. If the user is logging in for the first time, an account will be created from them in Terraform Enterprise. Their username will be autogenerated from their email address using the text before the `@`. The username will only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, or `_`. All invalid characters will be converted to `_`.
