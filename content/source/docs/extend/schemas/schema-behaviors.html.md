# Schema Behaviors

Schema fields that can have an effect at plan or apply time are collectively
referred to as "Behavioral fields", or an elements _behaviors_. These fields are
often combined in several ways to create different behaviors, depending on the
need of the element in question, typically customized to match the behavior of a
cloud service API. For example, at time of writing AWS Launch Configurations
cannot be updated through the AWS API. As a result all of the schema elements in
the corresponding Terraform Provider resource `aws_launch_configuration` are
marked as `ForceNew: true`. This behavior instructs Terraform to first destroy
and then recreate the resource if any of the attributes change in the
configuration, as opposed to trying to update the existing resource.

## Primitive Behaviors 
#### Optional
**Data structure:** [bool](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#bool)    
**Example:** `true` or `false`
**Restrictions:**
Cannot be used if `Required` is `true`
Must be set if `Required` is omitted **and** element is not `Computed`

Indicates that this element is optional to include in the configuration. Note that `Optional` does not itself establish a default value. See [Default]() below.

**Schema example:**

```go
"encrypted": {
  Type:     schema.TypeBool,
  Optional: true,
},
```

**Configuration example:**

```hcl
resource "example_volume" "ex" {
  encrypted = true
}
```

#### Required
**Data structure:** [bool](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#bool)    
**Example:** `true` or `false`  
**Restrictions:**
Cannot be used if `Optional` is `true`
Cannot be used if `Computed` is `true`
Must be set if `Optional` is omitted **and** element is not `Computed`

Indicates that this element must be provided in the configuration. Omiting this attribute from configuration, or later removing it, will result in a [plan-time]() error.

**Schema example:**

```go
"name": {
  Type:     schema.TypeString,
  Required: true,
},
```

**Configuration example:**

```hcl
resource "example_volume" "ex" {
  name = "swap volume"
}
```

#### Default
**Data structure:** [interface](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#interfaces)    
**Example:** any value of an elements `Type` for primitive types, or the type defined by `Elem` for complex types.
**Restrictions:**
Cannot be used if `Required` is `true`
Cannot be used with `DefaultFunc`

If `Default` is specified, that value that is used when this item is not set in the configuration. 

**Schema example:**

```go
"encrypted": {
  Type:     schema.TypeBool,
  Optional: true,
  Default: false,
},
```

**Configuration example (specified):**

```hcl
resource "example_volume" "ex" {
  name = "swap volume"
  encrypted = true
}
```

**Configuration example (omitted):**

```hcl
resource "example_volume" "ex" {
  name = "swap volume"
  # encrypted receives its default value, false
}
```

#### Computed
**Data structure:** [bool](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#bool)    
**Example:** `true` or `false`  
**Restrictions:**
Cannot be used when `Required` is `true`
Cannot be used when `Default` is `specified`
Cannot be used with `DefaultFunc`

`Computed` is often used to represent values that are not user configurable or can not be known at time of `terraform plan` or `apply`, such as date of creation or a service specific UUID. `Computed` can be combined with other attributes to achieve specific behaviors, and can be used as output for interpolation into other resources

**Schema example:**

```go
"uuid": {
  Type:     schema.TypeString,
  Computed: true,
},
```

**Configuration example:**

```hcl
resource "example_volume" "ex" {
  name = "swap volume"
  encrypted = true
}

output "volume_uuid" {
  value = "${example_volume.ex.uuid}"
}
```

#### ForceNew
**Data structure:** [bool](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#bool)    
**Example:** `true` or `false`  

`ForceNew` indicates that any change in this field requires the resource to be destroyed and recreated. 


**Schema example:**

```go
"base_image": {
  Type:     schema.TypeString,
  Required: true,
  ForceNew: true,
},
```

**Configuration example:**

```hcl
resource "example_instance" "ex" {
  name = "bastion host"
  base_image = "ubuntu_17.10" 
}
```


## Function Behaviors
#### DiffSuppressFunc
**Data structure:** [SchemaDiffSuppressFunc](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/ead558261d5e322f1f1e90c8e74834ba9215f24e/helper/schema/schema.go#L202)    

When provided `DiffSuppressFunc` will be used by Terraform to calculate the diff of this field. Common use cases are capitalization differences in string names, or logical equivalences in JSON values. 

**Schema example:**

```go
"base_image": {
  Type:     schema.TypeString,
  Required: true,
  ForceNew: true,
  # Supress the diff shown if the base_image name are equal when both compared in lower        #  case.
  DiffSuppressFunc: func(k, old, new string, d *schema.ResourceData) bool {
    if strings.ToLower(old) == strings.ToLower(new) {
      return true 
    }
    return false
  },
},
```

**Configuration example:**

Here we assume the service API accepts capitalizations of the `base_image` name and converts it to a lowercase string. The API then returns the lower case value in it’s responses. 

```hcl
resource "example_instance" "ex" {
  name = "bastion host"
  base_image = "UBunTu_17.10" 
}
```
#### DefaultFunc
**Data structure:** [SchemaDefaultFunc](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/ead558261d5e322f1f1e90c8e74834ba9215f24e/helper/schema/schema.go#L209)    
**Restrictions:**  
Cannot be used if `Default` is specified

When `DefaultFunc` will be used to compute a dynamic default for this element. The return value of this function should be "stable", such that it is uncommon to return different values in subsequent plans without any other changes being made, to avoid unnecessary diffs in `terraform plan`. 

`DefaultFunc` is most commonly used in Provider schemas, allows elements to have a default read from the environment. 

**Schema example:**

In this example, Terraform will attempt to read `region` from the environment if it is omitted from configuration. If it’s not found in the environment, a default value of `us-west` is given.

```go
"region": {
  Type:     schema.TypeString,
  Required: true,
  DefaultFunc: func() (interface{}, error) {
    if v := os.Getenv("PROVIDER_REGION"); v != "" {
      return v, nil
    }

    return "us-west", nil
  },
},
```

**Configuration example (provided):**

```hcl
provider "example" {
  api_key = "somesecretkey"
  region = "us-est"
}
```


**Configuration example (default func with `PROVIDER_REGION` set to `us-west` in the environment):**

```hcl
provider "example" {
  api_key = "somesecretkey"
  # region is "us-west"
}
```

**Configuration example (default func with `PROVIDER_REGION` unset in the environment):**

```hcl
provider "example" {
  api_key = "somesecretkey"
  # region is "us-east" 
}
```
